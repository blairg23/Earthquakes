Earthquakes
===========

Python script to plot earthquakes that have occurred in the world, using the Matplotlib Basemap module

===========

Additional Notes:

You will need the Basemap module to run this Python script. Instructions on how to do this can be found at this URL:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib-toolkits/

I have included the matplotlib module in the "Dependencies" directory of this GIT.
