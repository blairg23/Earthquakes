- Plotted most significant earthquakes
- Got colormap working
	- Worked on specific colors / alpha channels
- Plotted all earthquakes between 1973 and 2009 (n=17143)
- Tried to get audio working
	- Can play, but not record

- Formatted annotation / played with parameters
	- Had to format png file names and date to maintain preceding zeros
	- Worked with text coordinates
	- Entered coordinates, datetime, and magnitude
		- Formatted coordinates and datetime to be less obstructive to the visual
		- Formatted Magnitude to be more noticeable in the visual
	- Adjusted fontfamily to "serif"

- Used subplots to create more information for each earthquake
	- used subplot2grid to create a table for my subplots
	- used an alpha channel on my scatter plot
